## Moved

These was moved out of /test because (unsurprisingly) the old tests aren't happy with the new contracts and it was preventing truffle tests from succeeding. 

Can we separate hardhat and truffle tests? It's not clear they will ever play nice together. 

Coordination is one of the reasons we should touch down soon.
